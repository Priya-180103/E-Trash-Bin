# E-Trash-Bin

A E-Trash Bin that operates based on the principle of object detection works by using ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of objects when brought near the dustbin. 
The lid of the smart dustbin is connected to a motor. Upon receiving the signal from the control system, the motor activates, causing the lid to open.
Further it can be connected to an application to alert the user when the dustbin is filled.
